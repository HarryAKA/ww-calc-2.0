# Feb 3rd Notes, Feedback, and Todos
---

## General Notes
* ~~Bug: Unable to Explicitly Enter '0' into form fields~~ Fixed!

## Individual Calculator Notes

* Users confused about what's being referred to as "Income Tax" (federal or state?) suggestions: change to 'WA State Income Tax' or 'WA State Personal Health Assessment'
* Users note the Individual calculator does not ask them what their current health insurance premiums are - should be added for comparison purposes?
* Users should be asked to enter their 'AGI: Adjusted Gross Income' not 'Annual Income'
* Ryan suggests we add additional steps in the individual section and prompt users to provide an answer only if necessary.

## Business Calculator Notes

* Could definitely use some feedback from business users!!!
